        <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Greetings from Rotten-Brains. We hope that this Cookie Policy will
          provide you with information about how we use browser storage
          technology on our website. We are dedicated to giving you control over
          your online experience and being open and honest about how we manage
          user data.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">2. How Do Cookies Work?</h2>
        <p>
          Websites have the ability to transmit tiny text files called cookies
          to your browser, which are subsequently saved on your device. They are
          frequently used to improve the functionality of websites and give
          information to the site administrators. Similar functions can also be
          performed by other comparable technologies, including session storage,
          local storage, and web beacons.
        </p>

          3. How We Use Technologies for Browser Storage
        </h2>
        <p>
          Data minimization and user privacy are top priorities at
          Rotten-Brains. Thus:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-5 list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>3.1.</strong> Our website does not make use of conventional
            cookies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3.2.</strong> No user data is kept or logged on our servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3.3.</strong> Nevertheless, certain information might be
            kept locally in your browser for specific functional needs. This
            data doesn't belong to us; it stays on your device.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">
          4. Categories of Locally Stored Data
        </h2>
        <p>The information kept on file by your browser could be:</p>
        <ul className="ml-5 list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>4.1. Preferences:</strong> The themes and language settings
            that you prefer to watch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.2. Session Information:</strong> Transient data used to
            keep your online session alive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.3. User-Generated Content:</strong> Anything you make on
            our service, such as watchlists, reviews, or ratings.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">
          5. Local Storage's Objective
        </h2>
        <p>The data that is locally saved has multiple uses:</p>
        <ul className="ml-5 list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>5.1. Enhancing User Experience:</strong> We can offer a more
            customized and effective browsing experience by keeping track of
            your preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5.2. Preserving Functionality:</strong> For certain aspects
            of our website to function properly, local storage is required.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5.3. Preserving User-Generated Content:</strong> To
            guarantee that you may access your watchlists, ratings, and reviews
            throughout different browsing sessions, they are locally kept.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">
          6. Mastery of Your Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          The information kept in your browser is entirely under your control:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-5 list-disc">
          <li>
            <strong>6.1. Browser Settings:</strong> You may examine and remove
            locally stored data in the majority of online browsers. For detailed
            instructions, please consult the help documentation of your browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>6.2. Clearing Data:</strong> Using your browser's options,
            you may always remove all locally saved data from our website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>6.3. Disabling Local Storage:</strong> You can disable local
            storage in your browser's options, though this is not advised as it
            might affect how the site functions.
          </li>
        </ul>
